# Is this design, with Human and Computer sub-classes, better? Why, or why not?
  # This design is better because we don't have to specify the Player type in Player class as we can directly work with a Human or Computer class that has their own behaviour.

# What is the primary improvement of this new design?
  # The benefit is that we can treat the Human and Computer the same with the same method calls but the behaviours they exhibit are different - duck typing, polymorphism.

# What is the primary drawback of this new design?
  # We must duplicate our code in two classes and ensure both have the same behaviours
