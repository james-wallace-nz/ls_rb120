# Question 1

# Ben and Alyssa are working on a vehicle management system. So far, they have created classes called Auto and Motorcycle to represent automobiles and motorcycles. After having noticed common information and calculations they were performing for each type of vehicle, they decided to break out the commonality into a separate class called WheeledVehicle. This is what their code looks like so far:

module Moveable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_writer :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Moveable

  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
    # @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    # @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super([30,30,32,32], 50, 25.0)
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super([20,20], 80, 8.0)
  end
end

# Now Alan has asked them to incorporate a new type of vehicle into their system - a Catamaran defined as follows:

class Catamaran
  include Moveable

  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    # ... code omitted ...
  end
end

mazda = WheeledVehicle.new([30,30,32,32], 50, 25.0)
puts mazda.range

# This new class does not fit well with the object hierarchy defined so far. Catamarans don't have tires. But we still want common code to track fuel efficiency and range. Modify the class definitions and move code into a Module, as necessary, to share code among the Catamaran and the wheeled vehicles.

# We can move anything shared with the catamaran and wheeled vehicles into a new module (let's call it Moveable) that we include in both individual classes.

# Also, in the initializers of the classes that include the Moveable module, we must reference the setter methods that have been defined in Moveable (the fuel capacity and efficiency) using self. notation. If we don't use self. notation, an attempt to call one of the setters would be interpreted as setting local variables. Those variables would go out of scope when the initializers return.

    # Question:
    # Do we need to add the setters in Movable? Why expose a public setter if `@variable` still works?


# Question 2

# Building on the prior vehicles question, we now must also track a basic motorboat. A motorboat has a single propeller and hull, but otherwise behaves similar to a catamaran. Therefore, creators of Motorboat instances don't need to specify number of hulls or propellers. How would you modify the vehicles code to incorporate a new Motorboat class?


class Boat
  include Moveable

  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end
end

class Motorboat < Boat
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super(1, 1, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end

class Catamaran < Boat

end


# Question 3

# The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an adjustment for how the range of vehicles is calculated. For the seaborne vehicles, due to prevailing ocean currents, they want to add an additional 10km of range even if the vehicle is out of fuel.

# Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and motorcycles is still calculated as before, but for catamarans and motorboats, the range method will return an additional 10km.

class Boat
  # ...

  def range
    super + 10
  end
end

# We can override the `range` instance method in the `Boat` class so that the `Moveable` `range` method is still called for `WheeledVehicle`s
