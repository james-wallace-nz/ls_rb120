# Generic Greeting (part 2)

# Using the following code, add two methods: ::generic_greeting and #personal_greeting. The first method should be a class method and print a greeting that's generic to the class. The second method should be an instance method and print a greeting that's custom to the object.



# Expected output:
# Hello! I'm a cat!
# Hello! My name is Sophie!
